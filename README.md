# WebExtension: newTabPosition ![appicon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/em-te/webextension-newTabPosition/main/icon_48.png)

## Summary
Causes new tabs that usually open at the end of the tab stripe (tab bar) to open next to (on the right of) the current tab.

## Why
If you are in the middle of a bunch of tabs and decide to open a new tab to do a quick search and then close that tab, chances are you will be dropped at the end of the tab bar and you won't know the last tab you were looking at.

This extension will cause new blank tabs to be placed next to (on the right of) the last tab you were in, when you click on the new tab button (in the tab strip) or press Ctrl+T to open a new tab, 

This allows you tabs to be visually grouped together.

## Browser Support
This extension works on Chrome and Edge.

This extension is similar to the native "browserSettings.newTabPosition" setting on Firefox.

## Permissions
This extension requires no permissions.
